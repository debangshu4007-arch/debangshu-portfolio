You may take independent implementation decisions ONLY when:
- The change is directly required to complete the stated task
- The change does not alter existing architecture, routing, or design language
- The change does not affect files unrelated to the task

You must NOT:
- Refactor unrelated components
- Introduce new libraries unless explicitly asked
- Rename or restructure folders without justification

When uncertain, prefer the smallest, safest change.
